We’ll define two major modules:

1. Fluxion Learn (side documentation system)  
    → teaches players *why* trades win or lose  
    → integrated into battles \+ side content  
    → linked to *AI reasoning* and *on-chain reward proof*

2. NeuraCore Battle Algorithm (AI Simulation Engine)  
    → deterministic, market-backed duel engine that outputs a signed result  
    → uses real Solana market data (via Pyth)  
    → calculates profit/loss over time  
    → produces a replay \+ reasoning summary  
    → winner \= highest *risk-adjusted return* after N turns

# 🧭 PART 1 — FLUXION LEARN MODULE

### 🎯 Goal

To make Fluxion not just a “battle game” but a *DeFi learning platform*, where each battle, doc, and replay is a mini lesson.

---

## 1\. What it is

* A knowledge system integrated into the game — each trading concept (e.g., “volatility,” “stop-loss,” “shorting”) is a *Learn Module*.

* Modules are tagged to both:

  * Battles that demonstrated those concepts.

  * Interactive documents and micro-courses.

Players can learn, test, and even earn XP (or small on-chain proof of completion) for finishing modules.

---

## 2\. Architecture Overview

| Layer | Component | Role |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Frontend | /learn section \+ in-battle tooltips | Shows structured lessons & contextual explanations |
| Backend | CMS-like docs store (Markdown or MDX) | Hosts all learn modules, returns JSON to frontend |
| AI Engine (NeuraCore) | Tag concepts during battle | Attaches learn\_tags in replay summary (like “leverage,” “volatility spike”) |
| Smart Contract (optional) | register\_learning\_completion(owner, module\_id) | On-chain proof of learning completion |

---

## 3\. Learn Module Data Structure (backend)

Store each document in Markdown or JSON (like Notion pages). Example schema:

{  
  "id": "LM\_VOLATILITY",  
  "title": "Understanding Volatility",  
  "content": "Volatility measures how much prices move over time...",  
  "concept\_tags": \["volatility", "risk", "trading"\],  
  "estimated\_time": 5,  
  "difficulty": 2,  
  "reward\_xp": 50,  
  "next\_modules": \["LM\_STOP\_LOSS"\]  
}

Stored in /backend/learn\_modules/, served via /api/learn/:id.

---

## 4\. Frontend UI flow

* “📘 Learn” tab on navbar.

* Inside each replay, you can click *Learn More* → opens side drawer showing related concepts (e.g., *“Volatility Spike: what happened here?”*).

* Finishing a module calls:

  * POST /api/learn/complete → backend logs completion.

  * Optionally, front-end sends register\_learning\_completion(module\_id, proof\_hash) on-chain → marks it forever (for leaderboard XP).

---

## 5\. On-chain learning progress (optional)

Account: LearningProgress

\#\[account\]  
pub struct LearningProgress {  
    pub owner: Pubkey,  
    pub completed\_modules: Vec\<String\>, // or Vec\<\[u8;16\]\> for fixed-size ids  
    pub total\_xp: u64,  
}

Instruction:  
 register\_learning\_completion(module\_id, proof\_hash)

* Program verifies the proof\_hash \= SHA256(module\_id \+ wallet\_pubkey \+ secret\_salt\_from\_server)

* Prevents spam completions.

---

## 6\. Visual Design

Think of this like Apple Fitness rings but for *knowledge:*

\+-----------------------------------------+  
| 💡 Learn Dashboard                      |  
\+-----------------------------------------+

# 🧠 PART 2 — NEURACORE BATTLE MODEL

Now the main brain: how does Fluxion *decide who wins*.

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Every duel is a simulation of trading intelligence.  
 Two AI traders (or a player \+ AI) face off over *N turns* using real or synthetic market data.

The winner is determined by:

Highest Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe ratio variant)  
 over a fixed number of simulated steps.

---

## ⚙️ Engine Inputs

{  
  "battle\_id": "uuid",  
  "participants": \[  
    { "pubkey": "wallet1", "strategy": "momentum", "elo": 1250 },  
    { "pubkey": "AI\#01", "strategy": "mean\_reversion", "elo": 1300 }  
  \],  
  "market\_feed": {  
    "symbol": "SOL/USDC",  
    "interval": "1m",  
    "prices": \[24.1, 24.3, 23.9, 25.0, 24.7, ...\]  
  },  
  "params": {  
    "turns": 5,  
    "starting\_balance": 1000  
  },  
  "seed": "sha256(battle\_nonce \+ market\_feed\_hash)"  
}

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm — Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Initialize

Each trader starts with:

* Balance \= 1000 credits

* Position \= 0 (no holdings)

* Risk budget \= dynamic based on ELO (higher ELO → more precise, less random)

### Step 2: Turn Loop (for each price point)

For each turn:

1. Each trader’s AI model decides an action: Buy / Sell / Hold.

2. Decision derived from:

   * Historical pattern recognition

   * Strategy type

   * Deterministic pseudo-random bias (seeded RNG for fairness)

3. Apply price movement → update PnL (profit and loss)

4. Update performance metrics:

   * Total return

   * Max drawdown

   * Volatility of returns

   * Number of trades executed

### Step 3: Final Evaluation

After N turns, compute Final Metrics for both:

| Metric | Formula | Weight |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Return | (final\_balance \- 1000)/1000 | 40% |
| Drawdown | min(balance)/max(balance) | 15% |
| Trade Efficiency | (profitable\_trades / total\_trades) | 20% |
| Risk Control | penalize leverage \> threshold | 10% |
| Timing | average entry vs trend direction | 15% |

Compute score \= weighted sum of normalized metrics.

Winner \= highest score.

---

## 🔐 Determinism (key detail)

To ensure fairness and verifiability:

* Every decision must be *seeded*, not stochastic.

* Seed \= SHA256(engine\_secret \+ battle\_nonce \+ replay\_inputs).

* The exact same input → same output → same winner.

---

## 📊 Example Simulation (simplified)

| Turn | Price | Trader A | Trader B | Action | Result |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | 24.10 | Buy 10 | Hold | A: \+1.2% | A \+12 |
| 2 | 24.35 | Hold | Short 5 | B: \+0.6% | B \+6 |
| 3 | 23.90 | Sell | Hold | A: \-0.8% | B: \-0.3% |
| 4 | 25.00 | Hold | Buy 10 | A: \+2.5% | B: \+3.1% |
| 5 | 24.70 | Hold | Sell | A: \+2.1% | B: \+2.7% |

→ Trader A total return: \+2.1%  
 → Trader B total return: \+2.7%  
 → Drawdown lower for A, but B’s Sharpe higher.  
 ✅ Winner \= B

## 🧩 Backend Integration

* NeuraCore runs this simulation in a Docker container.

Outputs replay.json:

 {  
  "turns": \[...\],  
  "metrics": {  
    "return\_a": 0.021,  
    "return\_b": 0.027,  
    "sharpe\_a": 1.45,  
    "sharpe\_b": 1.56,  
    "winner": "trader\_b\_pubkey"  
  },  
  "tags": \["momentum", "risk\_management", "drawdown"\]  
}

*   
* Signs hash: sha256(replay.json) with engine private key.

* Returns {winner, hash, signature, replay} → goes on-chain.

---

## 🔗 On-Chain Linkage

In the Anchor BattleRecord PDA, store:

* battle\_hash

* replay\_cid

* winner

* metrics\_digest (optional short summary string)

* tags (optional, truncated concept tags)

These tags link to *Learn Modules* by concept (e.g., “volatility”, “risk”).

---

## 🧠 Optional AI extension: LLM commentary

After winner is decided, a separate lightweight LLM (Claude, GPT, or Mistral) can generate a commentary for learning UX.

*"Trader A bought too early during high volatility. Trader B waited for confirmation and minimized drawdown — better discipline."*

This text goes into replay.json.summary.commentary.

---

# ⚙️ Frontend Integration

### After battle ends:

1. Show winner with summary metrics.

2. Small badge: “Learn from this battle → \[Volatility Lesson\]”.

3. User clicks → opens Learn Module.

---

# 📐 Tech Correlation Summary

| Layer | Component | Function | Related Data |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| AI Engine (NeuraCore) | Deterministic duel sim | Decides winner | replay.json |
| Anchor Program | Verifies hash \+ stores winner | battle\_hash, metrics\_digest |  |
| Backend | Hosts AI \+ Learn CMS | simulation, docs, rewards |  |
| Frontend | Displays replay, shows linked lessons | replay → learn modules |  |
| DB | Maps concept tags to doc IDs | caching \+ indexing |  |

---

# 🧩 Implementation flow example

When a user finishes a battle:

1. AI sim runs simulation, tags "volatility", "momentum".

2. replay.json → signed → on-chain via submit\_battle\_result.

3. Frontend sees "tags": \["volatility"\].

4. Shows “You can learn this → \[Volatility Module\]”.

5. User clicks → opens /learn/volatility.

6. After finishing → backend logs completion → on-chain XP recorded.

---

Now Fluxion becomes a learning esport for DeFi:

* Battles \= Practical simulation of DeFi moves.

* Docs \= Theoretical knowledge.

* ELO \= Skill quantification.

* XP \= Knowledge quantification.

* Daily rewards \= retention.
